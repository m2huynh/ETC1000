    "text": "Preface\nStatistics is, at its heart, the language of evidence. In business and economics, it helps us make sense of uncertainty, identify patterns, and make better decisions — not by removing doubt, but by quantifying it. ETC1000: Business and Economic Statistics was designed to introduce students to this way of thinking: one grounded in data, guided by logic, and motivated by real-world questions.\nThis book serves as a companion for the ETC1000 unit, built on the principle that learning statistics is best achieved through doing, interpreting, and communicating — not memorising formulas. You’ll find that each chapter begins with a question or scenario that brings statistical thinking to life: from understanding whether a marketing campaign really boosted sales, to determining if housing prices differ between suburbs, or evaluating the fairness of a hiring process. These are the kinds of questions that analysts, economists, and business leaders face every day — and the kinds of skills you’ll develop throughout this unit.\nAcross the semester, we journey from descriptive to inferential statistics, from raw data to regression modelling, from spreadsheets to reproducible analysis in R. But more importantly, we move from numbers to stories — learning how to interpret, visualise, and explain statistical findings in ways that influence real decisions. This integration of computation and communication is at the heart of what it means to be data-literate in the modern world.\nIn this book, each chapter is designed to build naturally on the one before it, guiding you through the process of solving real-world problems using data. We usually begin with a clearly defined problem—this might be a research question, a business decision, or a practical scenario where evidence is needed to support an answer. From there, we introduce the statistical ideas, tools, and techniques that help move from raw data to meaningful conclusions:\nETC1000 has evolved over many years with input from hundreds of students and teaching staff. Their curiosity, feedback, and creativity have shaped the examples, visuals, and teaching strategies in these pages. Whether you’re studying statistics for the first time or revisiting it after years away, I hope this book helps you see statistics not as a hurdle to clear, but as a toolkit for discovery — one that empowers you to explore, question, and make sense of a complex world through data.",

    "text": "1.1 Why Statistics?\nOne of the first questions I like to ask when I take on a new unit is:\nIn this case … why is statistics a core part of your degree?\nFor those majoring in econometrics or business analytics, the answer might seem obvious. But many of you come from other sub-disciplines—marketing, management, banking and finance, etc., — and yet, you’re all required to study statistics.\nSo what is it about statistics that makes it essential across so many fields? To answer this question, read the case study regarding the NASA Challenger Disaster below.\nSo I come back to the question:\nNot everyone here is going to work at NASA or be in a role where your decisions could cost lives.\nHowever, every one of you will be expected to make decisions using data — whether you’re managing a budget, launching a product, analyzing customer feedback, or pitching a new strategy to stakeholders. Inaccurate assumptions, poor interpretation of trends, or blindly trusting a single number without questioning where it came from—these mistakes won’t make the news like the Challenger disaster did, but they can cost your company money, credibility, or opportunity. And more importantly, they can damage your own confidence and reputation as a professional.\nStatistics helps you avoid that. It teaches you not just how to calculate but how to think: how to challenge claims, test assumptions, and make sense of messy real-world data. That’s why this unit matters — not just for your degree, but for your ability to make smarter, more informed decisions, wherever your career takes you.",

    "text": "Why this unit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NASA Challenger disaster\n\n\n\nOn January 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger broke apart just 73 seconds after liftoff, killing all seven astronauts on board. The tragedy remains one of the most devastating examples of how misunderstanding data and poor statistical reasoning can have fatal consequences.\n\n\n\n\nPrior to the launch, engineers from Morton Thiokol, the contractor responsible for the shuttle’s O-ring seals, were concerned about the effects of cold temperature on the O-rings’ ability to prevent hot gases from escaping during launch. They had data from previous shuttle launches showing the number of O-ring failures (or “erosions”) and the temperature at launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, when Thiokol engineers presented their findings to NASA, the data were plotted incorrectly. They graphed the number of O-ring failures only for the launches that had experienced a failure—completely omitting all the launches where there were no failures. This meant that the plot showed no clear pattern, appearing to suggest that O-ring performance was random and unrelated to temperature. If the engineers had instead plotted all launches—including those with zero O-ring problems—against temperature (see plot below), the relationship would have been obvious:\n\nas the temperature dropped, the probability of O-ring failure increased sharply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Challenger launch occurred at 51°F, far colder than any previous launch, placing it in the highest-risk zone of all.\nDespite engineers’ warnings and uncertainty, NASA decided to proceed with the launch under immense schedule and political pressure. The misunderstanding of the statistical evidence—and the lack of clear data visualization—played a major role in the decision. When the Challenger lifted off, the cold temperature caused one of the O-rings to fail, leading to the explosion that destroyed the shuttle.\nIn short, if the data had been plotted correctly, the evidence against launching in such cold conditions would have been undeniable. Tragedy might have been averted through better understanding and communication of statistical relationships.\n\n\n\n\nWhy statistics?",

    "text": "1.2 Let him cook\n\nStatistics is a lot like cooking.\n\nSuppose I want to bake a cake for Mother’s Day.\n\nFirst, I prepare the ingredients.\nThen, I cook them — in this case, using an oven.\nFinally, I (hopefully) end up with the desired end product: a cake.\n\nNow imagine that instead of using an oven, I decided to use a deep fryer. Would I still get a cake? Probably not! The same goes for using a steamer, a blender, or a grill — each appliance is designed for a specific purpose and produces a different result.\nTo make a good cake, I need both the right ingredients and the right tool. Using the wrong one can lead to an unexpected or flawed outcome.\n\nThe same principle applies in statistics. Our tools are the various statistical tests and models available to us. Each is suited to a particular type of problem or research question. Our ingredients are the data we have — their type, structure, and quality.\n\nIf we use the wrong statistical tool for the data at hand, our results may be misleading or invalid, just like trying to bake a cake in a deep fryer.\n\n1.2.1 The Ingredients: Variables\nIn statistics, our ingredients are called variables. A variable is simply something that can vary — it can take on different values across people, objects, or situations. For example,\n\nIf we’re studying athletes, variables might include height, training hours, or reaction time.\nIn a business context, they might be sales revenue, customer satisfaction, or number of website visits.\n\nSome variables are numeric — they involve numbers that can be measured (like weight or income). Others are categorical, describing qualities or groups (like gender, position played, or brand preference). Knowing which kind of variable we have is like knowing whether we’re working with flour or sugar — it determines what “statistical recipe” we should follow.\nIf we treat every variable the same way, we might end up “deep-frying” our data instead of baking it. The secret to good statistical practice is understanding what each variable represents and choosing the right method to work with it.\n\n\n1.2.2 Numerical and Categorical Data\nIn this unit, we simplify our variables down to two types of data:\n\nNumerical\nCategorical\n\nIn analysing data, it is important to be aware of the different types of data. Different sorts of analyses are appropriate for different types of data (see section above on Cooking!). The following categorisation of data will come up throughout the unit:\n\n\nTypeDescriptionExampleNumericData that takes a numeric value.Height, Weight, Income, Exam scoreCategoricalData that can be classified into distinct categories.Country of birth, Eye colour, Employment status\n\n\nWhen distinguishing between data types, a useful strategy is to think about what the units of measurement are — or whether there even are any!\nIf the data have a clear unit (like meters, kilograms, seconds, or dollars), they’re most likely numerical — they involve quantities that can be measured and compared using a number. For instance, a runner’s time in seconds or a student’s test score both have meaningful numerical scales and units.\nIf there are no meaningful units — for example, if the data describe categories like “left-hand/right-hand,” “Yes/No,” or “Apple/Orange/Banana” — then we’re dealing with categorical data. These represent qualities or groupings rather than measurable amounts.\nThinking in terms of units helps guide what analyses are appropriate. You can’t sensibly take an average of “Apple” or “Blue,” but you can average numbers measured in kilograms or seconds. In other words, identifying the presence (or absence) of units tells you whether the data are about how much or what kind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Exercise 1.1\n\n\n\nConsider the variables below and choose the type of data associated with that variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nType\n\n\nAnnual Income\nNumericalCategorical\n\n\nEmployment Status\nNumericalCategorical\n\n\nMode of transportation\nNumericalCategorical\n\n\nTime spent at Company\nNumericalCategorical\n\n\nHighest level of Education\nNumericalCategorical",

    "section": "1.3 Understanding Categorical data",
    "text": "1.3 Understanding Categorical data\nThis week, we will focus our attention towards understanding categorical data analysis. To begin, read through the scenario below, which relates to two categorical variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise and Medical Conditions\n\n\n\nSuppose we had some qualitative information on 5,000 people in Australia including information on whether the individual has been diagnosed with a particular medical condition and the amount of exercise they do.\n\nIndividuals were asked to indicate their primary medical condition out of; ‘Asthma’, ‘Cancer’, ‘Depression’, ‘Diabetes’, ‘Heart Disease’ or ‘None of Above’.\nThey were also categorised by the amount of exercise they did each week; either ‘Moderate’ or ‘Minimal’ exercise.\n\nNote: In the real world, people can have multiple medical conditions at a given time. To keep this example simple, we will assume each person in this data set only has one condition.\n\n\nSource: https://www.lifelinehealthcarebd.org\n\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Tabular format\nThe table below is a snapshot of the data (showing just the first 8 people in the sample).\n\n\nPerson_IDConditionExercise1NoneModerate2Heart DiseaseModerate3DiabetesModerate4NoneModerate5NoneMinimal6NoneModerate7AsthmaMinimal8NoneModerate\n\n\nFor each person, we have collected two pieces of information: Condition and Exercise. It’s common the assign our subjects an ID number to make analysis more manageable (here: 1 to 8). Data that is arranged like the table above is considered data in tabular format, where each row corresponds to data for a single person. For example:\n\nPerson 1 has no medical conditions, and does moderate exercise.\nPerson 2 has heart disease and does moderate exercise.\nPerson 7 has asthma and does minimal exercise.\n\nBefore you do any sort of analysis, it’s important to have your data in tabular format.\n\n\n1.3.2 Visualising categories\nIt’s often a good idea to start all analyses by visualising the data. When dealing with categorical data, it’s useful to obtain the frequencies (or counts) for your variable(s) of interest.\nFor example, looking at our snapshot table from above, but only focusing on the Conditon variable, we can obtain the frequencies for each condition in this snapshot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Exercise 1.2\n\n\n\nComplete the frequency table for the second variable, Exercise:\n\n\nExerciseModerateModerateModerateModerateMinimalModerateMinimalModerate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nMinimal\n\n\n\nModerate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Bar charts\nAnother way to visualise your data is with plots. When plotting frequencies / counts, bar charts are often a good first choice. The height of the bars represent the counts – therefore it’s easy for people to quickly look at the plot and see which groups are high / low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Percentage plots\nWhen dealing with categorical data, sometimes* it’s useful to think of things in terms of percentages (looking at the tables above, why would percentages be a bad idea for small samples)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*For condition, one person is 12.5% of the data! This can be very misleading if we don’t know the raw counts.",

Note: we’ll be talking about conditional probabilities soon, so it’s better to have these in decimal format, rather than percentages.\nUsing these values, we can now talk about three types of probabilities:\n\nMarginal probabilities are our row and column probabilities.\n\nFor example, the probability that a randomly selected person does moderate exercise, is Pr(Moderate) = 0.3568\nAnd, the probability that a randomly selected person has diabetes, is Pr(Diabetes) = 0.0404\n\nThe cell values (excluding totals) within a contingency table tell us about the joint (or intersection) probabilities.\n\nFor example, the probability that a randomly selected person has diabetes AND does minimal exercise, Pr(Diabetes ∩ Minimal) = 0.0292\nAnd, the probability that a randomly selected person has diabetes AND does moderate exercise, Pr(Diabetes ∩ Moderate) = 0.0112\n\nConditional probabilities represent the probability of an event conditional on another event (and are our cell values divided by the row or column total).\n\nFor example, the probability someone has diabetes given they do minimal exercise, is Pr(Diabetes | Minimal) = 0.0454\nAnd, the probability someone has diabetes given they do moderate exercise, is Pr(Diabetes | Moderate) = 0.0314\n\n\nNote: We can also look at conditional probabilities row-wise as well.\n\nFor example, the probability someone does minimal exercise given they have Diabetes, is Pr(Minimal | Diabetes) = 0.7228\nAnd, the probability someone does moderate exercise given they have Diabetes, is Pr(Moderate | Diabetes) = 0.2772\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditional Probability Formula\n\n\n\nMathematically, conditional probabilities can be derived from the contingency table and the following formula:\n\\[Pr(A|B)=\\frac{Pr(A ∩ B)}{Pr(B)}\\] For example, suppose we wanted to determine the probability that someone has diabetes given they do minimal exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\nTotal\n\n\nMinimal\nModerate\n\n\n\n\nCondition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Asthma\n260\n166\n426\n\n\n    Cancer\n256\n125\n381\n\n\n    Depression\n323\n170\n493\n\n\n    Diabetes\n146\n56\n202\n\n\n    Heart Disease\n220\n43\n263\n\n\n    None of Above\n2,011\n1,224\n3,235\n\n\nTotal\n3,216\n1,784\n5,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis becomes:\n\\[Pr(Diabetes|Minimal)=\\frac{Pr(Diabetes ∩ Minimal)}{Pr(Minimal)}\\] \\[Pr(Diabetes|Minimal)=\\frac{146/5000}{3216/5000}\\] \\[Pr(Diabetes|Minimal)=0.0454\\]\n(Note: if you look at the “Divide by Column Totals” table above, you’ll see that this matches the answer here)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Exercise 1.4\n\n\n\nUsing the formula provide above, determine Pr(None of Above | Moderate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\nTotal\n\n\nMinimal\nModerate\n\n\n\n\nCondition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Asthma\n260\n166\n426\n\n\n    Cancer\n256\n125\n381\n\n\n    Depression\n323\n170\n493\n\n\n    Diabetes\n146\n56\n202\n\n\n    Heart Disease\n220\n43\n263\n\n\n    None of Above\n2,011\n1,224\n3,235\n\n\nTotal\n3,216\n1,784\n5,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[Pr(None|Moderate)=\\frac{Pr(None ∩ Moderate)}{Pr(Moderate)}\\] \\[Pr(None|Moderate)=\\frac{1224/5000}{1784/5000}\\] \\[Pr(None|Moderate)=0.6861\\]",

    "text": "1.5 Independence\nIn statistics, two categorical variables are said to be independent if the distribution of one variable does not depend on the other. In other words, knowing the value of one variable gives you no information about the value of the other. For example, if exercise habits are independent of work type, then the proportion of people who exercise regularly would be the same for both office-based and non-office workers.\nMathematically, there are a few different ways to check for independence. Two methods are shown below using our existing data set (suppose we want to check if having diabetes and amount of exercise is independent).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Independence (Method 1)\n\n\n\nOne method is to use the formula:\n\\[Pr(A|B_{1})=Pr(A|B_{2})=Pr(A)\\]\nIn this example,\n\nlet A = Diabetes\nB1 = Minimal Exercise\nB2 = Moderate Exercise\n\nHere:\n\nPr⁡(Diabetes)=0.0404\nPr⁡(Diabetes|Minimal)=0.0454\nPr⁡(Diabetes|Moderate)=0.0314\n\nTherefore:\nPr⁡(Diabetes|Minimal) ≠ Pr⁡(Diabetes|Moderate) ≠ Pr⁡(Diabetes)\nAnd since, these are not equal, we cannot assume independence. In other words, the likelihood of developing diabetes depends on how much exercise you do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Independence (Method 2)\n\n\n\nAnother common method for checking independence is shown here.\n\\[Pr(A∩B)=Pr(A)\\times Pr(B)\\]\nIn this example,\n\nlet A = Diabetes\nB = Minimal Exercise (we can use either Minimal or Moderate)\n\nHere:\n\nPr(A) = 202/5000 = 0.0404\nPr(B) = 3216/5000 = 0.6432\nPr(A∩B) = 146/5000 = .0292\n\nAnd:\n\nPr(A) x Pr(B) = 0.0404 x 0.6432 = 0.0260\n\nCompare with joint probability:\n\nDoes Pr(A∩B) = Pr(A) x Pr(B)?\n0.0292 ≠ 0.0260\nTherefore, having diabetes and amount of exercise are not independent\n\nNote: If you had used Moderate exercise as Pr(B) instead of Minimal exercise, you would still make the same conclusion.\n\n\nImportant: This check for independence assumes our probabilities are a good reflection of the population. Most of the time, you’ll only ever be working with sample data. In which case, we are looking for the probabilities to be approximately equal.\nIn later units, you will learn about these different tests and how to use them to check for independence (e.g. Chi-square Test). But for this unit, we will assume probabilities are exactly known and correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Exercise 1.5 (Challenge)\n\n\n\nSuppose you draw two cards from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, with replacement. Are the events “first card is an Ace” and “second card is also an Ace” independent?\nBegin byconstructing a 2x2 contingency table that looks something like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2nd Card: Ace\n2nd Card: Not Ace\nTotal\n\n\n1st Card: Ace\n\n\n\n\n\n1st Card: Not Ace\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you can use either method from above (for practice, try both!) to check if the events “first card is an Ace” and “second card is also an Ace” independent?\nSolutions can be found in the lecture recording",

A Pivot Table is an interactive summary table that allows you to group, count, and compare categories within your data. It’s particularly useful for:\n\nCreating frequency tables\nBuilding contingency tables\nExploring patterns and relationships between two categorical variables\n\nEssentially, a Pivot Table lets you “pivot” or rearrange your data to look at it from different perspectives — without changing the underlying dataset.\nFollow the instructions below to create PivotTables for this scenario. You will also learn how to change the raw counts to conditional probabilities.\n\n123456\n\n\nAfter you have loaded the data, click on the Insert Tab, then click PivotTable. This will open up the Create PivotTable dialog box. Excel usually does a good job of identifying the range of our data automatically (in this case cells A1 to C5001). We can then just click OK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new sheet will be created in your workbook, with PivotTable Fields appearing on the right of the window. To begin, let’s move Medical Condition into the Rows and Values boxes. This now creates a PivotTable that shows the counts of the conditions within our data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a contingency table, we can move a second variable into the columns field box. Let’s move Exercise into this box. Notice here that your pivot table will update automatically. Try moving the variables to different field boxes to see what happens!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default the PivotTable shows the counts or frequencies. We can very easily change these to row or column totals to show conditional probabilities. Right-click on any number with the table, then select Show Values As and select % of Column Total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur table now shows the conditional probability (column-wise). We can also change the format of the table and how the values are presented (e.g. %, decimal, etc.). Click on the Home tab, highlight the data, then switch to decimal. You can also increase / decrease decimal places as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also copy and paste a PivotTable quite easily to show different things. Have a go at creating two PivotTables - one that shows the conditional probability (column-wise), and one that shows the conditional probability (row-wise). Use the screenshot here to check your answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6.2 Excel formulas (Challenge Task)\nWhile PivotTables are a fast and flexible way to summarise categorical data, it’s also valuable to know how to perform these calculations manually using Excel formulas. Understanding the underlying formulas helps you see how the summaries are generated and gives you more control when customising reports or creating automated dashboards. This can be a valuable skill to add to your CV. Note: there are many ways to complete this task. The screenshots below suggest only one of these methods.\n\n1234567891011\n\n\nUse the UNIQUE function to find all levels of the Medication Condition variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s remove the formulas from these cells. Copy the cell contents and paste over it as “values only”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional: Switch to the Data tab and arrange the data alphabetically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can do the same for the levels of Exercise as well (although because we only have 2 categories it’s faster just to type them out).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the COUNTIFS function to count how many cases have asthma and minimal exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag this formula down for all medical conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat for the Moderate Exercise column\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the SUM function to calculate the row totals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat for the column totals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy and Paste the tables twice to two different places on the workbook. Remove the values, such that only the row and column labels remain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the conditional probabilities for each table by dividing the cell value by either their respective row / column totals.",

    "text": "1.7 Summary\nIn this chapter, we built the foundations for understanding data in statistics — beginning with the concept of a variable. A variable is any characteristic or property that can take on different values across individuals or observations. Recognising what kind of variable you’re dealing with is essential because it determines the type of analysis and visualisation that are appropriate.\nWe classified variables into two main types:\n\nNumerical variables, which represent quantities that can be measured and expressed with meaningful units (e.g., height in centimeters, income in dollars, reaction time in seconds).\nCategorical variables, which describe qualities, groups, or classifications without meaningful numerical scales (e.g., gender, country of birth, eye color).\n\nUnderstanding whether a variable has units of measurement helps determine which type it is — and consequently, which statistical “recipe” to use.\nWe also introduced the idea of tabular data, where each row represents one observation (e.g., one person) and each column represents a variable. This structure is fundamental for statistical analysis because it allows data to be organised, summarised, and visualised systematically.\nFrom there, we examined how to explore relationships between two categorical variables using contingency tables (or cross-tabulations). These tables display the frequency of each possible combination of categories, helping us observe patterns and associations between variables.\nThis led to the introduction of key probability concepts:\n\nMarginal probabilities: the overall probabilities of a single event occurring (e.g., the proportion of people who exercise regularly).\nJoint probabilities: the probability that two events occur together (e.g., someone both has diabetes and exercises minimally).\nConditional probabilities: the probability of one event occurring given that another has occurred (e.g., the probability of having diabetes given minimal exercise).\n\nFinally, we explored the idea of independence. Two categorical variables are independent if the probability of one event does not change based on the outcome of the other. In other words, knowing one provides no information about the other. We learned two ways to check for independence — by comparing conditional probabilities or by testing whether\n\\[Pr(A∩B)=Pr(A)×Pr(B)\\]\nUnderstanding these concepts — how variables are defined and structured, how relationships between them are summarised in tables, and how probability underpins their interpretation — provides the essential groundwork for all statistical reasoning and inference that follows.",

The data is based on the 2015 Australian Census, and covers the Metropolitan Melbourne region.\nThe table below shows the poverty rates for Melbourne for different types of households, in terms of number of parents and number of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold\nN children = 1\nN children = 2\nN children = 3\nN children = 4\nTotal\n\n\nSingle parent\n16.9%\n23.5%\n27.6%\n34.3%\n20.6%\n\n\nTwo parents\n6.7%\n6.3%\n7.9%\n15.4%\n7.2%\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that a Melbourne household with a single parent and two children will be poor?\nWhat does the number 20.6% in the last column mean?\nDiscuss the patterns in this table – how does the poverty rate vary with number of parents and number of children? Give some intuition for the patterns you find.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.235\n20.6% of all single-parent households have incomes that fall below the poverty line\nN Parents: The poverty rate is much lower for two-parent households compared to single-parent households. It could be that single-parent households may need to trade off some (or all) of their working capacity to take care of their children (i.e. work part-time and earn less). Whereas in two-parent households, the second parent may be more able to work full-time.\nN Children: The poverty rate appears to increase as the number of children increases. Perhaps those who have fewer children are more career-oriented rather than family-oriented. This trade-off would see these households earning more and therefore less likely to fall under the poverty line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\n\nThe tables below relate to the scenario from the previous question, and show the percentage of poverty according to household type.\nTable 1.

Explain your reasoning. Give some intuition for why this dependence is likely to be present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48.3% of households living below the poverty line consist of a single parent.\nUsing Table 1: The probability is 0.190 (or 19.0%).\nUsing Table 2: Pr(3 children | 2 parents) + Pr(4 children | 2 parents) = 19.1 + 12.3 = 31.4%\nSince we already have Table 2 (conditional probabilities), we will use that approach\nP(1 child | single parent) = 45.7%\nP(1 child | two parents) = 31.8%\nTherefore not independent\nIntuitive explanation: Single-parent households are more likely to have only one child, while two-parent households are more likely to have multiple children. This dependence likely exists because: (1) Raising children is more manageable with two parents, (2) Two-parent households typically have higher combined incomes and shared responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\n\nDownload the file below and open it in Excel.\n\n\n Travellers\n\n\nThe sheet “Travellers” contains a worksheet of raw data. The data have been collected from 3999 travellers as they arrived at Melbourne airport. The sheet contains the country (region) they came from and the main purpose of their visit (work, study or tourism), so there are two categorical variables to be examined: one is “Region” and the other is “Purpose”.\n\nCreate a univariate pivot table which looks at the purpose of travel – i.e. study, work or tourism. Examine and comment on the frequency of these three travel purposes.\nConstruct a contingency table which shows the percentage of travellers with different purposes by their region. Which region has the highest proportion of people coming for the purposes of study?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow Labels\nCount of purpose\n\n\nstudy\n1559\n\n\ntourism\n1247\n\n\nwork\n1193\n\n\nGrand Total\n3999\n\n\n\nIt appears that travellers tend to visit Melbourne mainly for the purpose of study, and they are less likely to visit Melbourne for work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow Labels\nAmericas\nAsia\nEurope\nMiddle East\nGrand Total\n\n\nstudy\n45.82%\n52.13%\n18.25%\n41.44%\n38.98%\n\n\ntourism\n46.08%\n24.47%\n48.42%\n10.04%\n31.18%\n\n\nwork\n8.10%\n23.40%\n33.33%\n48.52%\n29.83%\n\n\nGrand Total\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n\n\n\nIt is clear that in terms of traveling purpose, more than half of the Asian travellers visit Melbourne for study, while almost half of European travellers are tourists. To sum up, travellers from different regions visit Melbourne for different purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\n\nThis question will use the same file from the previous exercise. Begin by switching to the sheet labelled “HDI & Schooling”. It contains data from the Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI is an index produced by the United Nations that ranks countries from highest to lowest human development. The index rank is determined based on a number of different measures of development of an economy-based on measures of life expectancy, education and income. The data sheet provides the 2013 rankings for countries with complete data on the relevant development measures, geographical region within which the country is located, along with average years of schooling.\nConstruct a pivot table with “Region” on the rows and “HDI Category” on the columns. From your pivot tables, determine the following:\n\nPr(East Asia & Pacific)\nPr(Sub-Saharan Africa)\nPr(Very High HDI)\nPr(East Asia & Pacific ∩ Medium HDI)\nPr(Sub-Saharan Africa ∩ Low HDI)\nPr(North America ∩ Very High HDI)\nPr(Medium HDI | East Asia & Pacific)\nPr(Low HDI | Sub-Saharan Africa)\nPr(Very High HDI | North America)\nPr(East Asia & Pacific | Medium HDI)\nPr(Sub-Saharan Africa | Low HDI)\nPr(North America | Very High HDI)\nCheck whether the probability of having a “Low HDI” is independent of “Region”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPr(East Asia & Pacific) = 0.1444\nPr(Sub-Saharan Africa) = 0.246\nPr(Very High HDI) = 0.2513\nPr(East Asia & Pacific ∩ Medium HDI) = 0.0802\nPr(Sub-Saharan Africa ∩ Low HDI) = 0.1925\nPr(North America ∩ Very High HDI) = 0.0107\nPr(Medium HDI | East Asia & Pacific) = 0.5556\nPr(Low HDI | Sub-Saharan Africa) = 0.7826\nPr(Very High HDI | North America) = 1\nPr(East Asia & Pacific | Medium HDI) = 0.3191\nPr(Sub-Saharan Africa | Low HDI) = 0.7826\nPr(North America | Very High HDI) = 0.0426\nPr(Low HDI | East Asia & Pacific) = 0.1111\nPr(Low HDI | Europe & Central Asia) = 0.0000\nPr(Low HDI) = 0.2460\nNot independent",
